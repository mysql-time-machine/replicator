/**
 * class: RowTimestampOrganizer
 * <p>
 * This class takes care that all HBase rows with same row_id in same table have different timestamp.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes one may observe long-lasting transactions with query time few minutes before commit time
 * So writing data with query time may lead to situation that data would be seen existing some time
 * before it really existed. To solve this, we need to write replicated changes with the time of
 * transaction commit - not time of the query.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, setting one single time to all events in transaction is dangerous for a case
 * when there are several modifications to one cell in the transaction.
 * When all of these changes have same timestamp, only one (one that was written last) will be stored
 * in HBase, so we lose previous changes.
 * Another case is that of the event written last to HBase is not always last chronologically, so
 * we would end up having differences between source data and final version of HBase data
 * <p>
 * The way we avoid this situation is:
 * <p>
 * We shift the timestamp of a 1st row for every table/pk combination to be a certain interval of
 * microseconds before the commit_timestamp. Default side of the this SPAN interval is 50 microseconds.
 * <p>
 * Every next event for this table/PK combination will be put 1 microsecond later, with the exception when
 * reaching the end of the SPAN interval (50 micros in current implementation), events after that one will
 * all have timestamp equal to the finish event
 * <p>
 * Here we assume that all events timestamps in transaction were already set to commit_time in the previous
 * steps in the pipeline.
 * <p>
 * We support up to 50 changes for 1 table/PK combinations in 1 transaction
