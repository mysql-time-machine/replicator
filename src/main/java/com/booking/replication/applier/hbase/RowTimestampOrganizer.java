/**
 * This class takes care that all HBase rows with same row_id in same table have different timestamp.
 *
 * Sometimes one may observe long-lasting transactions with query time few minutes before commit time
 * So writing data with query time may lead to situation that
 *   data would be seen existing some time before it really existed
 * So we want to write replicated changes with time of transaction commit - not time of query
 *
 * Setting one single time to all events in transaction is dangerous for a case when there are several
 *   modifications of one cell in a transaction
 * When all of these changes have same timestamp only one (one that was written last) will be stored in HBase
 * So we may loose fact of changes
 * Or because of asynchronous processing event written last will be not really last so we will have differences
 *   between source data and final version of HBase data
 *
 * We want to avoid this situation
 * So we want to set different timestamps to different events in single transaction.
 * If transaction is very big then setting different timestamp to every event is risky
 *   because it may cause transactions overlapping
 * So we would like to change timestamps to different for every row: primary-key and table combination
 *
 * To achieve this we put 1st row for every table/pk combination SPAN (50 in current implementation)
 *   microseconds before finish timestamp.
 * Every next event for this table/PK combination will be put 1 microsecond later
 * With exception when reaching SPAN (50 in current implementation) events when all later ones
 *   will have timestamp equal to finish event
 *
 * So here we assume all event timestamps in transaction were set to finish events.
 * We support up to 50 changes for 1 table/PK combinations in 1 transaction
